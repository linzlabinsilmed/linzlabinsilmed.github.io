    🌟Scientific visit at IHU Liryc🌟


    Our colleague Argyrios Petras recently visited IHU LIRYC - Heart rhythm
    disease Institute in Bordeaux from July 7th to 16th. The visit was funded by
    FFG Austrian Research Promotion Agency Bridge project "PFA-Mod" which is led
    by Argyrios and NumeriCor GmbH.


    During his stay, Argyrios and the team worked on designing and conducting
    experiments to collect data on Pulse Field Ablation (PFA) lesions in animal
    models. This milestone marks an important step in the project’s progress, as
    these data are essential for validating our computational models and
    improving the accuracy of cardiac digital twins  ❤️ 🖥️ used in cardiac
    ablation treatments. Many thanks to Guido Caluori, Konstantinos Vlachos, and
    the entire Liryc team for their support.


    Additionally, special thanks to Ed Vigmond for hosting and facilitating this
    productive visit.


    Looking forward to the next phases of the project!

    📄New Paper Alert!📄


    We are excited to share our first study on laser ablation in cardiac tissue
    in collaboration with Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma! Laser ablation
    is a promising technique for treating cardiac arrhythmias, offering high
    precision and minimal invasiveness. However, traditional thermal models fall
    short in predicting tissue response at fast time scales. As part of her PhD
    work, Federica Bianconi designed a finite element computational model that
    couples optical and thermal physics to better simulate how laser energy
    interacts with heart tissue.


    💡 What we did:

    🔹 Developed a finite element model combining light propagation (using the
    Optical Diffusion Approximation) with thermal bioheat transfer theories  -
    including Fourier, Generalized Fourier, and a higher-order Dual Phase 

    Lag (DPL) model.

    🔹 Incorporated a three-state cell death model to map out how damage
    progresses over time during laser ablation.

    🔹Simulated cardiac tissue response and explored how tissue anisotropy
    affects thermal spread.


    🔎Key Insights from the Study:

    🔹 The higher-order DPL model provides the most detailed and accurate
    framework for predicting heat transfer in cardiac tissue.

    🔹 Laser power modulation plays a crucial role in shaping lesion depth and 

    precision - better control can minimize harm to surrounding healthy 

    tissue.

    🔹 Tissue fiber structure matters: anisotropic properties strongly
    influence 

    lesion geometry, reinforcing the need for personalized ablation strategies.


    These advancements pave the way for personalised treatment planning and in
    silico 💻 optimisation of laser ablation techniques. 


    🤝 This work was made possible through the contributions of Massimiliano
    Leoni, Argyrios Petras, Emiliano Schena, Luca Gerardo-Giorda, and Alessio
    Gizzi.


    We would like to congratulate Federica Bianconi on reaching this important
    milestone and wish her continued success on her PhD journey! 👏
