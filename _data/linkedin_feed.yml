    📄New Paper Alert!📄


    We are excited to share our first study on laser ablation in cardiac tissue
    in collaboration with Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma! Laser ablation
    is a promising technique for treating cardiac arrhythmias, offering high
    precision and minimal invasiveness. However, traditional thermal models fall
    short in predicting tissue response at fast time scales. As part of her PhD
    work, Federica Bianconi designed a finite element computational model that
    couples optical and thermal physics to better simulate how laser energy
    interacts with heart tissue.


    💡 What we did:

    🔹 Developed a finite element model combining light propagation (using the
    Optical Diffusion Approximation) with thermal bioheat transfer theories  -
    including Fourier, Generalized Fourier, and a higher-order Dual Phase 

    Lag (DPL) model.

    🔹 Incorporated a three-state cell death model to map out how damage
    progresses over time during laser ablation.

    🔹Simulated cardiac tissue response and explored how tissue anisotropy
    affects thermal spread.


    🔎Key Insights from the Study:

    🔹 The higher-order DPL model provides the most detailed and accurate
    framework for predicting heat transfer in cardiac tissue.

    🔹 Laser power modulation plays a crucial role in shaping lesion depth and 

    precision - better control can minimize harm to surrounding healthy 

    tissue.

    🔹 Tissue fiber structure matters: anisotropic properties strongly
    influence 

    lesion geometry, reinforcing the need for personalized ablation strategies.


    These advancements pave the way for personalised treatment planning and in
    silico 💻 optimisation of laser ablation techniques. 


    🤝 This work was made possible through the contributions of Massimiliano
    Leoni, Argyrios Petras, Emiliano Schena, Luca Gerardo-Giorda, and Alessio
    Gizzi.


    We would like to congratulate Federica Bianconi on reaching this important
    milestone and wish her continued success on her PhD journey! 👏

    for severe lung failure, conducted together with our clinical partners at
    Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH - especially Jens Meier and Johannes
    Szasz. 


    Additionally, our group is working with Philip-Rudolf Rauch from Kepler
    Universitätsklinikum GmbH to better understand the mechanisms driving
    low-grade glioma progression.


    As a technically oriented team, we deeply value our growing partnerships

    🌟 Is a single lethal electric field threshold sufficient to characterize
    the lesion size in computational modeling of cardiac pulsed-field ablation
    ❔🌟   


    PFA is revolutionizing the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, and although it
    shows great promise, it's still a relatively new technology. Computational
    models can help predict how the treatment affects heart tissue. Typically,
    these models rely on identifying a lethal electric field threshold to
    predict the lesion. However, discrepancies in predicted lesion anisotropy
    ratios (width over depth) across recent studies continue to be a topic of
    discussion. In our latest work, we evaluated the predicted lesion anisotropy
    ratios using a PFA computational model by applying it to an open-chest in
    vivo porcine model geometry.


    💡 What we did:

    🔹Developed a finite-element computational model based on a segmented swine
    CT scan, mimicking the open-chest experimental setup.

    🔹Tested different electric field thresholds (200–1000 V/cm) to see which
    best predicts lesion depth and width.

    🔹Analyzed lesion depth and width, comparing how well different thresholds
    matched the actual experimental findings.


    🔎  Key Insights from the Study: 

    🔹A  single lethal electric field threshold is INSUFFICIENT to accurately
    predict both lesion depth and width in cardiac PFA.

    🔹The threshold between 270 and 500 V/cm accurately predicts lesion depth,
    and a higher threshold between 790 and 1000 V/cm better captures the lesion
    width.

    🌟Welcome Back🌟 


    Join us in welcoming Federica Bianconi back to Linz Lab for In-Silico
    Medical Interventions! Federica is a PhD student at Università Campus
    Bio-Medico di Roma, working under the guidance of Alessio Gizzi. During her
    first visit in the fall of 2023, she got hands-on experience with FEniCSx
    (https://fenicsproject.org/) and successfully developed her cardiac laser
    ablation application. Stay tuned – we'll be sharing her latest results
    soon! 


    We’re excited to have her with us and look forward to seeing her progress!

    🔬 New Research Alert🔬


    We are excited to share our latest study published in Scientific Reports!
    Our PhD student Minha Anees Msc and colleagues from Linz Lab for In-Silico
    Medical Interventions and Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Spain
    explored how dispersive patch placement affects power dissipation during
    radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) - a widely
    used treatment for atrial fibrillation. 


    💡 What we did:

    🔹 Developed a highly detailed 3D virtual patient model based on CT imaging
    data

    🔹Ran 80 computer simulations to test different dispersive patch positions
    and power settings (25W vs. 90W)

    🔹Analyzed power dissipation in cardiac and esophageal tissue to optimize
    ablation safety and effectiveness


    🔎  Key Insights from the Study: 

    🔹Patch placement matters!  Placing the dispersive patch at the lower right
    side of the anterior thorax reduces the esophageal power dissipation -
    making it a good candidate location for avoiding esophageal tissue injury.

    🔹Wall thickness matters! High-power ablations can effectively create
    transmural lesions in thin tissues, while in thicker tissues, increased
    tissue power alone isn't enough - thermal conduction is crucial for driving
    the lesion deeper.


    Our in-silico study, based on detailed patient CT data, provides new
    insights into electric field distribution during RFA. These findings could
    help refine clinical protocols and improve patient outcomes.


    A big congratulations to our colleagues, and especially to Minha Anees Msc,
    for this achievement! 👏 Wishing her all the best as she continues her PhD
    journey.
