    🌟 NumeriCor Cardiac Modelling Summit 2025 🌟 

     

    Argyrios Petras attended the NumeriCor GmbH Cardiac Modelling Summit 2025,
    held on October 20–21 in Graz. This event brought together experts in
    cardiac modelling for two days of inspiring talks and discussions. It was
    great to hear about exciting work in cardiac modelling from Martin Bishop,
    Mohammadreza Kariman, Daniel Scherr, and Ursula Rohrer. 


    During the event, Argyrios Petras gave a presentation on “In Silico
    Optimization of PFA Catheters,” highlighting how computational modelling can
    support the optimization of ablation procedures. This work is supported by
    the BRIDGE project of the FFG Austrian Research Promotion Agency, carried
    out in collaboration with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Many thanks to Gernot Plank, Aurel Neic and Luca Azzolin for organizing such
    a well-run and motivating event. We look forward to continuing our
    collaboration and future projects together!

    🌟 Video Tutorials 🌟


    Our Linz Lab for In-Silico Medical Interventions is also active in teaching
    at Johannes Kepler Universität Linz! 🎓 


    To support our students, we’ve prepared several tutorials on segmentation
    using 3D Slicer and meshing with Salome. Both are open-source tools that can
    be used in computational modelling pipelines. Watch the tutorials on our
    YouTube channel and give them a try! 📺

    🌟 Research Visit 🌟 


    September was a busy month for Argyrios Petras, ending with a visit to the
    Instituto de Ingeniería Matemática y Computacional at the Pontificia
    Universidad Católica de Chile from September 18 to 26.


    Argyrios has a long-established collaboration with Nicolás Alejandro Barnafi
    Wittwer, and this visit was a great opportunity to advance their ongoing
    joint work. He also had the chance to discuss his research with colleagues
    at the institute and gave a talk on Computational Methods for Cardiac
    Catheter Ablation Procedures ❤️ 💻 .


    A big thank you to Argyrios Petras for his hard work, and thanks to the 

    Instituto de Ingeniería Matemática y Computacional, especially Nicolás
    Alejandro Barnafi Wittwer, for the warm welcome 🤗 . We’re excited to see
    the results of this collaboration!

    Our team had the pleasure of participating in this year’s Computing in
    Cardiology! Argyrios Petras presented our lab’s current research through
    three talks:


    🔬 Advancing PFA Modelling
     Argyrios presented his first-author work, “Tissue anisotropy is insufficient to capture experimental lesion morphology in cardiac PFA modelling”. This talk highlighted the challenges of accurately replicating lesion shapes in computational models.

    🔥 Linking Cardiac Ablation and Esophageal Safety

    He also presented a talk, “A Three-State Thermal Cell Death Model for the
    Assessment of Esophageal Damage in Cardiac Ablation”, based on the
    bachelor's thesis of Jakob Haselbacher that was prepared in collaboration
    with our team. This study proposes a new approach to modelling tissue
    response and assessing safety risks.

    ❤️ Patient-Specific Insights into RF Ablation

    Finally, Argyrios presented the outcomes of Minha Anees Msc research in a
    talk, “Impact of Body Mass Index on Power Distribution in High-Power RF
    Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation: Insights from Virtual Patients”. Her work
    shows how patient variability, such as BMI, can influence ablation outcomes.

    We would also like to thank the CinC 2025 organisers for putting together
    such an inspiring event, and we are already looking forward to CinC 2026! 👏

    🌟 MiGEM Workshop 🌟


    On September 11th, our colleague Argyrios Petras participated in the
    International Workshop on Gastrointestinal Biomechanics & Motility at
    Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma. The workshop was supported by the
    ERC-funded MiGEM project, which aims to develop a comprehensive,
    multi-scale, thermodynamically and energetically consistent multiphysics
    model of gastrointestinal motility.


    During the workshop, Argyrios discussed the use of computational methods for
    catheter ablation therapies. While Argyrios’ research primarily focuses on
    cardiac applications, his talk showcased how these computational methods can
    be adapted to advance our understanding and treatment of gastrointestinal
    conditions.


    It was exciting to see how diverse expertise from Alessio Gizzi, Leo Cheng,
    Daniel Hurtado, René Thierry Djoumessi, Argyrios Petras and Sebastian
    Brandstäter came together to establish connections and potential
    collaborations for gastrointestinal applications.


    Many thanks to the organisers, namely Alessio Gizzi, Federica Bianconi, Anna
    Crispino and Lorenzo Zoboli, for making this inspiring exchange possible!

    🌟ICCB 2025🌟


    Our colleagues Argyrios Petras and Minha Anees Msc represented our group at
    the XI International Conference on Computational Bioengineering (ICCB 2025),
    held from September 8–10 in Rome. This event was hosted by the Università
    Campus Bio-Medico di Roma and focused on advances in the modelling of
    physiological systems. 


     🔹 Argyrios Petras chaired two sessions on digital twins for cardiac
    interventional procedures, which featured 8 insightful talks. He also
    presented on behalf of Nicolás Alejandro Barnafi Wittwer their collaborative
    work on poroelastic media.


    🔹 Minha Anees Msc shared part of her PhD research on sex-based anatomical
    differences in pulmonary vein isolation.


    🔹  Federica Bianconi from Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma presented
    her joint work with our lab on computational modelling of laser-induced
    heating in cardiac tissue.


    A big thank you to the organisers, especially conference chair Prof. Alessio
    Gizzi and Federica Bianconi, Anna Crispino and Lorenzo Zoboli from the local
    organising committee, for hosting such an inspiring and well-organised
    event! 🙌

    🌟Scientific visit at IHU Liryc🌟


    Our colleague Argyrios Petras recently visited IHU LIRYC - Heart rhythm
    disease Institute in Bordeaux from July 7th to 16th. The visit was funded by
    FFG Austrian Research Promotion Agency Bridge project "PFA-Mod" which is led
    by Argyrios and NumeriCor GmbH.


    During his stay, Argyrios and the team worked on designing and conducting
    experiments to collect data on Pulse Field Ablation (PFA) lesions in animal
    models. This milestone marks an important step in the project’s progress, as
    these data are essential for validating our computational models and
    improving the accuracy of cardiac digital twins  ❤️ 🖥️ used in cardiac
    ablation treatments. Many thanks to Guido Caluori, Konstantinos Vlachos, and
    the entire Liryc team for their support.


    Additionally, special thanks to Ed Vigmond for hosting and facilitating this
    productive visit.


    Looking forward to the next phases of the project!

    🌟DEAB Conference🌟


    From June 16th to 20th , our group leader Luca Gerardo-Giorda attended the
    conference Differential Equations and Applications to Biology that took
    place at the University of Le Havre Normandy. This conference was organised
    in memory of friend and colleague Pierre Magal, whose legacy continues to
    inspire the community️. The goal of this international conference was to
    bring together leading researchers from differential equations, dynamical
    systems, and mathematical biology to communicate with each other about their
    current work and to remember Pierre’s contribution to the field 📚. 


    Luca was invited to give a plenary lecture titled "Patient-specific
    simulation in support of cardiovascular intervention." He presented recent
    advances in endocardial ablation treatments for arrhythmias and
    extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), developed in collaboration with
    the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona and the Kepler
    Universitätsklinikum GmbH in Linz. 


    The conference reminded us that behind every scientific journey is a
    community bound by shared purpose, curiosity, and the people who inspire us
    along the way 🤝 Thank you to the organisers for creating such a meaningful
    event!
