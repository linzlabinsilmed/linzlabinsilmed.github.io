    🌟 Collaborating on Epidemiological Modelling 🌟


    We were delighted to host Michela Sabbatino, a PhD student from the
    Università di Trento, at our lab last week. Michela’s research focuses on
    developing a spatial epidemiological model to describe and predict the
    spread of West Nile Virus 🦠🗺️ in Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy), an
    increasingly important topic in infectious disease modelling.


    During her stay, she worked under the supervision of Luca Gerardo-Giorda,
    deepening her expertise in advanced numerical simulations 💻 and the finite
    element method applied to real-world epidemiological challenges. We were
    impressed by her dedication and scientific curiosity, and we look forward to
    seeing how her work progresses 🚀.


    Thank you, Michela, for your great work, and we hope to welcome you back
    soon!👏

    🎉 Celebrating Team Growth!🎉


    We’re delighted that Laura Füssel continues her journey with us at the Linz
    Lab for In-Silico Medical Interventions!


    Laura, a master’s student in Industrial Mathematics at Johannes Kepler
    Universität Linz, recently successfully defended her bachelor’s thesis 🎓 on
    the comparison of in-vitro experiments and in-vivo applications of
    Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA), a treatment for cardiac
    arrhythmia,  conducted under the guidance of Argyrios Petras and Luca
    Gerardo-Giorda. 


    She will continue contributing to our ongoing research, with a focus on
    computational modeling in Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA). Her work aims to
    simulate the PFA procedure, with a particular focus on modeling the
    interaction between the catheter and cardiac tissue through advanced contact
    mechanics simulations. This work is supported by the FFG Austrian Research
    Promotion Agency BRIDGE project obtained by Argyrios Petras in collaboration
    with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Outside her busy academic schedule, Laura enjoys going for a run 🏃♀️ and
    travelling to explore the world ✈️.


    We’re looking forward to her continued contributions and wish her all the
    best in this next phase of her journey!🚀

    🌟 EBTT 2025 🌟 


    Our colleagues Argyrios Petras and Luca Pasini recently attended the
    EBTT 2025 (Electroporation-Based Technologies & Treatments) postgraduate
    course in Ljubljana from November 10–15, organized by the University of
    Ljubljana, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, in collaboration with the
    Institute of Oncology Ljubljana.


    The week offered an intensive program of expert lectures 📚 , hands-on
    laboratory exercises 🧪 , computer modelling 🖥️ , and hardware development
    sessions ⚡ , covering both fundamental and advanced topics in
    electroporation research. Participants explored applications ranging from
    cardiac pulsed-field ablation to drug delivery, and engaged in practical
    experiments such as visualizing gas bubble formation, measuring induced
    transmembrane voltage, and developing pulsed-power devices.


    Argyrios Petras gave a talk on “Competing mechanisms for anisotropic lesion
    formation in cardiac PFA modelling”, while Luca Pasini, at the start of his
    PhD, gained invaluable first-hand exposure to the field, connecting with
    leading researchers and experiencing cutting-edge laboratory techniques.


    Many thanks to the organizers, namely Damijan Miklavčič and his team at
    University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Electrical Engineering for creating such
    an engaging and practical course 👏 . EBTT 2025 provided a fantastic
    opportunity to learn, gain hands-on experience, and connect with leading
    experts, and we are already looking forward to the next edition! 🎉

    🎉 Welcoming a New Colleague! 🎉 


    A warm welcome to Luca Pasini, who joins our Linz Lab for In-Silico Medical
    Interventions!


    Luca earned both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Biomedical
    Engineering from the Politecnico di Torino. As part of his master’s thesis,
    he designed and implemented a computational multiscale model to study
    Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy, a chronic pathology associated with heart
    transplant rejection. His research focused on simulating lymphocyte
    transport within coronary arteries to gain deeper insights into the
    mechanisms driving disease progression.


    Now joining our lab as a PhD student under the supervision of Argyrios
    Petras, Luca is focusing on computational modeling in Pulsed Field Ablation
    (PFA). His work aims to simulate the PFA procedure and its effects on
    cardiac tissue, and to validate the models on experimental data to help
    optimise patient-specific treatments. This work is supported by the FFG
    Austrian Research Promotion Agency BRIDGE project obtained in collaboration
    with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Outside the lab, Luca enjoys the outdoors, with a passion for climbing and
    mountain adventures 🏔️ . With the Alps so close to Linz, he’s excited to
    take his adventures to the next level.


    We wish Luca Pasini all the best on his journey and look forward to the
    contributions he will bring to the team! 🚀

    🌟 NumeriCor Cardiac Modelling Summit 2025 🌟 

     

    Argyrios Petras attended the NumeriCor GmbH Cardiac Modelling Summit 2025,
    held on October 20–21 in Graz. This event brought together experts in
    cardiac modelling for two days of inspiring talks and discussions. It was
    great to hear about exciting work in cardiac modelling from Martin Bishop,
    Mohammadreza Kariman, Daniel Scherr, and Ursula Rohrer. 


    During the event, Argyrios Petras gave a presentation on “In Silico
    Optimization of PFA Catheters,” highlighting how computational modelling can
    support the optimization of ablation procedures. This work is supported by
    the BRIDGE project of the FFG Austrian Research Promotion Agency, carried
    out in collaboration with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Many thanks to Gernot Plank, Aurel Neic and Luca Azzolin for organizing such
    a well-run and motivating event. We look forward to continuing our
    collaboration and future projects together!

    🌟 Video Tutorials 🌟


    Our Linz Lab for In-Silico Medical Interventions is also active in teaching
    at Johannes Kepler Universität Linz! 🎓 


    To support our students, we’ve prepared several tutorials on segmentation
    using 3D Slicer and meshing with Salome. Both are open-source tools that can
    be used in computational modelling pipelines. Watch the tutorials on our
    YouTube channel and give them a try! 📺

    🌟 Research Visit 🌟 


    September was a busy month for Argyrios Petras, ending with a visit to the
    Instituto de Ingeniería Matemática y Computacional at the Pontificia
    Universidad Católica de Chile from September 18 to 26.


    Argyrios has a long-established collaboration with Nicolás Alejandro Barnafi
    Wittwer, and this visit was a great opportunity to advance their ongoing
    joint work. He also had the chance to discuss his research with colleagues
    at the institute and gave a talk on Computational Methods for Cardiac
    Catheter Ablation Procedures ❤️ 💻 .


    A big thank you to Argyrios Petras for his hard work, and thanks to the 

    Instituto de Ingeniería Matemática y Computacional, especially Nicolás
    Alejandro Barnafi Wittwer, for the warm welcome 🤗 . We’re excited to see
    the results of this collaboration!

    Our team had the pleasure of participating in this year’s Computing in
    Cardiology! Argyrios Petras presented our lab’s current research through
    three talks:


    🔬 Advancing PFA Modelling
     Argyrios presented his first-author work, “Tissue anisotropy is insufficient to capture experimental lesion morphology in cardiac PFA modelling”. This talk highlighted the challenges of accurately replicating lesion shapes in computational models.
    Preprint: https://lnkd.in/evKFyxJS


    🔥 Linking Cardiac Ablation and Esophageal Safety

    He also presented a talk, “A Three-State Thermal Cell Death Model for the
    Assessment of Esophageal Damage in Cardiac Ablation”, based on the
    bachelor's thesis of Jakob Haselbacher that was prepared in collaboration
    with our team. This study proposes a new approach to modelling tissue
    response and assessing safety risks.

    ❤️ Patient-Specific Insights into RF Ablation

    Finally, Argyrios presented the outcomes of Minha Anees Msc research in a
    talk, “Impact of Body Mass Index on Power Distribution in High-Power RF
    Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation: Insights from Virtual Patients”. Her work
    shows how patient variability, such as BMI, can influence ablation outcomes.

    We would also like to thank the CinC 2025 organisers for putting together
    such an inspiring event, and we are already looking forward to CinC 2026! 👏
