    🌟TNF-MED Interaction 🌟


    Most recent Thursday, we presented our latest research at the 4th TNF-MED
    Interaction, organised by the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences
    (TNF) together with the Faculty of Medicine (MED) at Johannes Kepler
    University. The TNF-MED Interaction is designed to share recent research
    and, more importantly, to strengthen collaboration between engineering,
    natural sciences, and medicine.


    🔹 Neurooncology

    Our medical collaborator Philip-Rudolf Rauch from the Department of
    Neurosurgery at Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH (KUK) showed how digital
    twins can be used to study the progression of glioma tumours. This work,
    carried out in collaboration with Luca Gerardo-Giorda and Davide Baroli,
    demonstrates the value of close collaboration between researchers and
    clinicians.


    🔹 Cardiac interventions

    Our group leader Luca Gerardo-Giorda presented our latest results on
    in-silico modelling of ablation treatments, with a particular focus on
    cardiac applications of radiofrequency and pulsed-field ablation. This
    research is primarily led by Argyrios Petras and his team of undergraduate
    and graduate students.


    🔹 VV-ECMO

    Beata Ondrusova, our postdoctoral researcher, shared recent results on the
    use of computational fluid dynamics to study patient-specific blood flow
    patterns in VV-ECMO patients. This work is carried out in close
    collaboration with Jens Meier, head of Anesthesiology and Operative
    Intensive Care Medicine at Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH.


    We really appreciated the opportunity not only to present our work, but also
    to learn about the research of other groups and explore potential
    collaborations. Many thanks to the organisers for putting together such a
    well-run and inspiring event 👏 . We are looking forward to future editions
    of TNF-MED! 🥳

    🌟 Matteo Joins Our Team! 🌟 


    A warm welcome to Matteo Micocci, the newest member of our Linz Lab for
    In-Silico Medical Interventions! 


    Matteo earned his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Alma
    Mater Studiorum – Università di Bologna, where he developed a model to
    predict the positioning of foot bones when subjected to mechanical load. To
    further his studies, he pursued a Master’s degree in Biomechanics at the
    Politecnico di Torino.


    Now working at our lab for his Master’s thesis under the supervision of
    Davide Baroli, Matteo is focusing on the simulation of aortic coarctation, a
    condition affecting pediatric patients. His research aims to create a
    computational model that can enhance the understanding of the disease by
    considering both short- and long-term effects to help optimize patient
    outcomes.


    Outside the lab, Matteo is passionate about sports and the outdoors, with a
    love for mountain hiking 🥾, climbing  🏔️  , and running 🏃 . Living so
    close to the Alps, he is eager to explore the surrounding peaks and trails. 


    Wishing Matteo an inspiring journey with us! We’re excited for the ideas and
    energy he’ll bring to the team. 🎉

    🌟Team Spotlight: Minha in Bordeaux🌟


    Our colleague Minha Anees Msc spent the month of November at the Modelling
    Department at IHU LIRYC - Heart rhythm disease Institute in Bordeaux,
    working under the expert guidance of Ed Vigmond, focusing on cardiac
    cellular electrophysiology models.


    During her time there, Minha worked extensively with openCARP, gained
    hands-on experience in setting up simulation pipelines💻, and strengthened
    her skills in interpreting complex electrophysiological modelling outputs
    🫀.


    We sincerely thank Ed Vigmond and the entire team for their warm welcome and
    support 🤝.  We are excited to see how Minha applies her new knowledge and
    skills to advance her work!✨

    🌟 Collaborating on Epidemiological Modelling 🌟


    We were delighted to host Michela Sabbatino, a PhD student from the
    Università di Trento, at our lab last week. Michela’s research focuses on
    developing a spatial epidemiological model to describe and predict the
    spread of West Nile Virus 🦠🗺️ in Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy), an
    increasingly important topic in infectious disease modelling.


    During her stay, she worked under the supervision of Luca Gerardo-Giorda,
    deepening her expertise in advanced numerical simulations 💻 and the finite
    element method applied to real-world epidemiological challenges. We were
    impressed by her dedication and scientific curiosity, and we look forward to
    seeing how her work progresses 🚀.


    Thank you, Michela, for your great work, and we hope to welcome you back
    soon!👏

    🎉 Celebrating Team Growth!🎉


    We’re delighted that Laura Füssel continues her journey with us at the Linz
    Lab for In-Silico Medical Interventions!


    Laura, a master’s student in Industrial Mathematics at Johannes Kepler
    Universität Linz, recently successfully defended her bachelor’s thesis 🎓 on
    the comparison of in-vitro experiments and in-vivo applications of
    Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA), a treatment for cardiac
    arrhythmia,  conducted under the guidance of Argyrios Petras and Luca
    Gerardo-Giorda. 


    She will continue contributing to our ongoing research, with a focus on
    computational modeling in Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA). Her work aims to
    simulate the PFA procedure, with a particular focus on modeling the
    interaction between the catheter and cardiac tissue through advanced contact
    mechanics simulations. This work is supported by the FFG Austrian Research
    Promotion Agency BRIDGE project obtained by Argyrios Petras in collaboration
    with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Outside her busy academic schedule, Laura enjoys going for a run 🏃♀️ and
    travelling to explore the world ✈️.


    We’re looking forward to her continued contributions and wish her all the
    best in this next phase of her journey!🚀
