    🌟 Matteo Joins Our Team! 🌟 


    A warm welcome to Matteo Micocci, the newest member of our Linz Lab for
    In-Silico Medical Interventions! 


    Matteo earned his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Alma
    Mater Studiorum – Università di Bologna, where he developed a model to
    predict the positioning of foot bones when subjected to mechanical load. To
    further his studies, he pursued a Master’s degree in Biomechanics at the
    Politecnico di Torino.


    Now working at our lab for his Master’s thesis under the supervision of
    Davide Baroli, Matteo is focusing on the simulation of aortic coarctation, a
    condition affecting pediatric patients. His research aims to create a
    computational model that can enhance the understanding of the disease by
    considering both short- and long-term effects to help optimize patient
    outcomes.


    Outside the lab, Matteo is passionate about sports and the outdoors, with a
    love for mountain hiking 🥾, climbing  🏔️  , and running 🏃 . Living so
    close to the Alps, he is eager to explore the surrounding peaks and trails. 


    Wishing Matteo an inspiring journey with us! We’re excited for the ideas and
    energy he’ll bring to the team. 🎉

    🌟Team Spotlight: Minha in Bordeaux🌟


    Our colleague Minha Anees Msc spent the month of November at the Modelling
    Department at IHU LIRYC - Heart rhythm disease Institute in Bordeaux,
    working under the expert guidance of Ed Vigmond, focusing on cardiac
    cellular electrophysiology models.


    During her time there, Minha worked extensively with openCARP, gained
    hands-on experience in setting up simulation pipelines💻, and strengthened
    her skills in interpreting complex electrophysiological modelling outputs
    🫀.


    We sincerely thank Ed Vigmond and the entire team for their warm welcome and
    support 🤝.  We are excited to see how Minha applies her new knowledge and
    skills to advance her work!✨

    🌟 Collaborating on Epidemiological Modelling 🌟


    We were delighted to host Michela Sabbatino, a PhD student from the
    Università di Trento, at our lab last week. Michela’s research focuses on
    developing a spatial epidemiological model to describe and predict the
    spread of West Nile Virus 🦠🗺️ in Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy), an
    increasingly important topic in infectious disease modelling.


    During her stay, she worked under the supervision of Luca Gerardo-Giorda,
    deepening her expertise in advanced numerical simulations 💻 and the finite
    element method applied to real-world epidemiological challenges. We were
    impressed by her dedication and scientific curiosity, and we look forward to
    seeing how her work progresses 🚀.


    Thank you, Michela, for your great work, and we hope to welcome you back
    soon!👏

    🎉 Celebrating Team Growth!🎉


    We’re delighted that Laura Füssel continues her journey with us at the Linz
    Lab for In-Silico Medical Interventions!


    Laura, a master’s student in Industrial Mathematics at Johannes Kepler
    Universität Linz, recently successfully defended her bachelor’s thesis 🎓 on
    the comparison of in-vitro experiments and in-vivo applications of
    Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA), a treatment for cardiac
    arrhythmia,  conducted under the guidance of Argyrios Petras and Luca
    Gerardo-Giorda. 


    She will continue contributing to our ongoing research, with a focus on
    computational modeling in Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA). Her work aims to
    simulate the PFA procedure, with a particular focus on modeling the
    interaction between the catheter and cardiac tissue through advanced contact
    mechanics simulations. This work is supported by the FFG Austrian Research
    Promotion Agency BRIDGE project obtained by Argyrios Petras in collaboration
    with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Outside her busy academic schedule, Laura enjoys going for a run 🏃♀️ and
    travelling to explore the world ✈️.


    We’re looking forward to her continued contributions and wish her all the
    best in this next phase of her journey!🚀

    🌟 EBTT 2025 🌟 


    Our colleagues Argyrios Petras and Luca Pasini recently attended the
    EBTT 2025 (Electroporation-Based Technologies & Treatments) postgraduate
    course in Ljubljana from November 10–15, organized by the University of
    Ljubljana, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, in collaboration with the
    Institute of Oncology Ljubljana.


    The week offered an intensive program of expert lectures 📚 , hands-on
    laboratory exercises 🧪 , computer modelling 🖥️ , and hardware development
    sessions ⚡ , covering both fundamental and advanced topics in
    electroporation research. Participants explored applications ranging from
    cardiac pulsed-field ablation to drug delivery, and engaged in practical
    experiments such as visualizing gas bubble formation, measuring induced
    transmembrane voltage, and developing pulsed-power devices.


    Argyrios Petras gave a talk on “Competing mechanisms for anisotropic lesion
    formation in cardiac PFA modelling”, while Luca Pasini, at the start of his
    PhD, gained invaluable first-hand exposure to the field, connecting with
    leading researchers and experiencing cutting-edge laboratory techniques.


    Many thanks to the organizers, namely Damijan Miklavčič and his team at
    University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Electrical Engineering for creating such
    an engaging and practical course 👏 . EBTT 2025 provided a fantastic
    opportunity to learn, gain hands-on experience, and connect with leading
    experts, and we are already looking forward to the next edition! 🎉

    🎉 Welcoming a New Colleague! 🎉 


    A warm welcome to Luca Pasini, who joins our Linz Lab for In-Silico Medical
    Interventions!


    Luca earned both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Biomedical
    Engineering from the Politecnico di Torino. As part of his master’s thesis,
    he designed and implemented a computational multiscale model to study
    Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy, a chronic pathology associated with heart
    transplant rejection. His research focused on simulating lymphocyte
    transport within coronary arteries to gain deeper insights into the
    mechanisms driving disease progression.


    Now joining our lab as a PhD student under the supervision of Argyrios
    Petras, Luca is focusing on computational modeling in Pulsed Field Ablation
    (PFA). His work aims to simulate the PFA procedure and its effects on
    cardiac tissue, and to validate the models on experimental data to help
    optimise patient-specific treatments. This work is supported by the FFG
    Austrian Research Promotion Agency BRIDGE project obtained in collaboration
    with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Outside the lab, Luca enjoys the outdoors, with a passion for climbing and
    mountain adventures 🏔️ . With the Alps so close to Linz, he’s excited to
    take his adventures to the next level.


    We wish Luca Pasini all the best on his journey and look forward to the
    contributions he will bring to the team! 🚀

    🌟 NumeriCor Cardiac Modelling Summit 2025 🌟 

     

    Argyrios Petras attended the NumeriCor GmbH Cardiac Modelling Summit 2025,
    held on October 20–21 in Graz. This event brought together experts in
    cardiac modelling for two days of inspiring talks and discussions. It was
    great to hear about exciting work in cardiac modelling from Martin Bishop,
    Mohammadreza Kariman, Daniel Scherr, and Ursula Rohrer. 


    During the event, Argyrios Petras gave a presentation on “In Silico
    Optimization of PFA Catheters,” highlighting how computational modelling can
    support the optimization of ablation procedures. This work is supported by
    the BRIDGE project of the FFG Austrian Research Promotion Agency, carried
    out in collaboration with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Many thanks to Gernot Plank, Aurel Neic and Luca Azzolin for organizing such
    a well-run and motivating event. We look forward to continuing our
