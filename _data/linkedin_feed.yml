    🔥 Linking Cardiac Ablation and Esophageal Safety

    He also presented a talk, “A Three-State Thermal Cell Death Model for the
    Assessment of Esophageal Damage in Cardiac Ablation”, based on the
    bachelor's thesis of Jakob Haselbacher that was prepared in collaboration
    with our team. This study proposes a new approach to modelling tissue
    response and assessing safety risks.

    🌟 MiGEM Workshop 🌟


    On September 11th, our colleague Argyrios Petras participated in the
    International Workshop on Gastrointestinal Biomechanics & Motility at
    Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma. The workshop was supported by the
    ERC-funded MiGEM project, which aims to develop a comprehensive,
    multi-scale, thermodynamically and energetically consistent multiphysics
    model of gastrointestinal motility.


    During the workshop, Argyrios discussed the use of computational methods for
    catheter ablation therapies. While Argyrios’ research primarily focuses on
    cardiac applications, his talk showcased how these computational methods can
    be adapted to advance our understanding and treatment of gastrointestinal
    conditions.


    It was exciting to see how diverse expertise from Alessio Gizzi, Leo Cheng,
    Daniel Hurtado, René Thierry Djoumessi, Argyrios Petras and Sebastian
    Brandstäter came together to establish connections and potential
    collaborations for gastrointestinal applications.


    Many thanks to the organisers, namely Alessio Gizzi, Federica Bianconi, Anna
    Crispino and Lorenzo Zoboli, for making this inspiring exchange possible!

    🌟Scientific visit at IHU Liryc🌟


    Our colleague Argyrios Petras recently visited IHU LIRYC - Heart rhythm
    disease Institute in Bordeaux from July 7th to 16th. The visit was funded by
    FFG Austrian Research Promotion Agency Bridge project "PFA-Mod" which is led
    by Argyrios and NumeriCor GmbH.


    During his stay, Argyrios and the team worked on designing and conducting
    experiments to collect data on Pulse Field Ablation (PFA) lesions in animal
    models. This milestone marks an important step in the project’s progress, as
    these data are essential for validating our computational models and
    improving the accuracy of cardiac digital twins  ❤️ 🖥️ used in cardiac
    ablation treatments. Many thanks to Guido Caluori, Konstantinos Vlachos, and
    the entire Liryc team for their support.


    Additionally, special thanks to Ed Vigmond for hosting and facilitating this
    productive visit.


    Looking forward to the next phases of the project!

    🌟DEAB Conference🌟


    From June 16th to 20th , our group leader Luca Gerardo-Giorda attended the
    conference Differential Equations and Applications to Biology that took
    place at the University of Le Havre Normandy. This conference was organised
    in memory of friend and colleague Pierre Magal, whose legacy continues to
    inspire the community️. The goal of this international conference was to
    bring together leading researchers from differential equations, dynamical
    systems, and mathematical biology to communicate with each other about their
    current work and to remember Pierre’s contribution to the field 📚. 


    Luca was invited to give a plenary lecture titled "Patient-specific
    simulation in support of cardiovascular intervention." He presented recent
    advances in endocardial ablation treatments for arrhythmias and
    extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), developed in collaboration with
    the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona and the Kepler
    Universitätsklinikum GmbH in Linz. 


    The conference reminded us that behind every scientific journey is a
    community bound by shared purpose, curiosity, and the people who inspire us
    along the way 🤝 Thank you to the organisers for creating such a meaningful
    event!
