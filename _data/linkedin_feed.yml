    🎉 Celebrating Team Growth!🎉


    We’re delighted that Laura Füssel continues her journey with us at the Linz
    Lab for In-Silico Medical Interventions!


    Laura, a master’s student in Industrial Mathematics at Johannes Kepler
    Universität Linz, recently successfully defended her bachelor’s thesis 🎓 on
    the comparison of in-vitro experiments and in-vivo applications of
    Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA), a treatment for cardiac
    arrhythmia,  conducted under the guidance of Argyrios Petras and Luca
    Gerardo-Giorda. 


    She will continue contributing to our ongoing research, with a focus on
    computational modeling in Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA). Her work aims to
    simulate the PFA procedure, with a particular focus on modeling the
    interaction between the catheter and cardiac tissue through advanced contact
    mechanics simulations. This work is supported by the FFG Austrian Research
    Promotion Agency BRIDGE project obtained by Argyrios Petras in collaboration
    with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Outside her busy academic schedule, Laura enjoys going for a run 🏃♀️ and
    travelling to explore the world ✈️.


    We’re looking forward to her continued contributions and wish her all the
    best in this next phase of her journey!🚀

    🎉 Welcoming a New Colleague! 🎉 


    A warm welcome to Luca Pasini, who joins our Linz Lab for In-Silico Medical
    Interventions!


    Luca earned both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Biomedical
    Engineering from the Politecnico di Torino. As part of his master’s thesis,
    he designed and implemented a computational multiscale model to study
    Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy, a chronic pathology associated with heart
    transplant rejection. His research focused on simulating lymphocyte
    transport within coronary arteries to gain deeper insights into the
    mechanisms driving disease progression.


    Now joining our lab as a PhD student under the supervision of Argyrios
    Petras, Luca is focusing on computational modeling in Pulsed Field Ablation
    (PFA). His work aims to simulate the PFA procedure and its effects on
    cardiac tissue, and to validate the models on experimental data to help
    optimise patient-specific treatments. This work is supported by the FFG
    Austrian Research Promotion Agency BRIDGE project obtained in collaboration
    with NumeriCor GmbH.


    Outside the lab, Luca enjoys the outdoors, with a passion for climbing and
    mountain adventures 🏔️ . With the Alps so close to Linz, he’s excited to

    🌟 MiGEM Workshop 🌟


    On September 11th, our colleague Argyrios Petras participated in the
    International Workshop on Gastrointestinal Biomechanics & Motility at
    Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma. The workshop was supported by the
    ERC-funded MiGEM project, which aims to develop a comprehensive,
    multi-scale, thermodynamically and energetically consistent multiphysics
    model of gastrointestinal motility.


    During the workshop, Argyrios discussed the use of computational methods for
    catheter ablation therapies. While Argyrios’ research primarily focuses on
    cardiac applications, his talk showcased how these computational methods can
    be adapted to advance our understanding and treatment of gastrointestinal
    conditions.


    It was exciting to see how diverse expertise from Alessio Gizzi, Leo Cheng,
    Daniel Hurtado, René Thierry Djoumessi, Argyrios Petras and Sebastian
    Brandstäter came together to establish connections and potential
    collaborations for gastrointestinal applications.


    Many thanks to the organisers, namely Alessio Gizzi, Federica Bianconi, Anna
    Crispino and Lorenzo Zoboli, for making this inspiring exchange possible!
