- title: Motivation
  description: Brain tumors remain one of the most difficult conditions to treat due to their location within the central nervous system, where even small lesions can significantly affect neurological function. Treatment is often complicated by the sensitivity of surrounding brain tissue and the limited effectiveness of current therapies. Gaining a deeper understanding of how brain tumors develop, and progress is essential for advancing diagnosis and guiding therapy. Among brain tumors, gliomas are the most common and aggressive, known for their invasive growth, high recurrence rates, and resistance to conventional treatment. 

- title: What is Glioma?
  description: Gliomas are primary brain tumors that arise from glial cells - the supportive cells of the central nervous system. They include several subtypes, ranging from low-grade gliomas with slower progression to high-grade glioblastomas that grow rapidly and infiltrate healthy brain tissue.

- title: The Role of In-Silico Modelling
  description: Our team uses in-silico modelling to investigate how gliomas grow and progress within brain tissue. These computational models allow us to simulate tumor cell proliferation, invasion patterns, and interactions with the surrounding environment over time. By incorporating patient-specific anatomic models, we aim to better understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of glioma progression. <br><br>We work closely with neurologists to ensure our models reflect real clinical challenges, helping us gain deeper insight into glioma progression and support the development of more personalized treatment strategies.
